/**
 * The Lock class provides a way to synchronize concurrent processes.
 *
 * In a multi-process environment, Lock objects should be created in the parent process so that child processes can
 * acquire the locks.
 *
 * It's not recommend to use locks in the event callback functions like onConnect(), onReceive() and so on. This could
 * cause memory leaks since memory usage could keep increasing as new requests keep coming in. In general, it's not
 * recommended to keep creating/destroying locks since this could cause memory leaks.
 *
 * This Lock class is not coroutine-friendly. It should not be used across different coroutines, especially when there
 * are coroutine switching between method calls to \Swoole\Lock::lock() and \Swoole\Lock::unlock(). For example, the
 * following example will cause deadlock:
 *
 *   Swoole\Coroutine\run(function () {
 *       $lock = new Swoole\Lock();
 *       for ($i = 0; $i < 2; $i++) {
 *           Swoole\Coroutine::create(function () use ($lock) {
 *               $lock->lock();
 *               Swoole\Coroutine::sleep(1);
 *               $lock->unlock();
 *           });
 *       }
 *   });
 *
 * If you think you need to use locks with coroutines, there are two options:
 * 1. use channels (before Swoole 6.0.1).
 * 2. use class \Swoole\Coroutine\Lock (since Swoole 6.0.1).
 *
 * @see \Swoole\Thread\Lock Use this instead when PHP is compiled with Zend Thread Safety (ZTS) enabled.
 * @see \Swoole\Coroutine\Lock Use this instead when using locks accross coroutines.
 * @see https://github.com/deminy/swoole-by-examples/blob/master/examples/csp/deadlocks/swoole-lock.php
 * @not-serializable Objects of this class cannot be serialized.
